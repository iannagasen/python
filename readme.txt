_116_objects_and_classes
  dir(object)
    - returns the list of all the valid attributes in methods of the object
    
    names which begins and end with double underscore implements operator:
      Ex: __add__() implements the + operator

    this are also known as `DUNDER METHODS`

_117_modules

  with statement
    - is a control structure used to managed resources that need to be cleaned up or released when they are no longer needed.
    - similar to try-with statement in JAVA

  namespace
    - a container that holds a collection of identifiers 
      (such as  variable names, funciton names, class names, etc) and their corresponding objects
    - Each namespace is like a dictionary, where:
      keys -> identifiers
      values -> the object they refer to
    - Different types of namespace:
      1. Global namespace
        - which contains the names defined at the top level of a module
      2. Local namespaces
        - which contain the names defined within a function or method
      3. Built tin namespaces
        - which contain the names of built in functions and modules
    
    - is closely related to JAVA's package
    - python namespace vs java package
      - java does not provide a way to create custom namespaces for variables or functions.
        Instead, all variables or functions are defined within a class or interface, 
        and their names are scoped to that class or interface
      - java does not have the notion of global namespace like python does,
        all variables and functions must be defined within a class or method

_118_script_writing
  
  Any file can execute either as a script or as a library imported with import
  To better support imports, script code is often enclosed with a conditional check against the module name:

  __name__ 
    - a builtin variable that always contains the name of the enclosing module.
    - if a program is run as the main script such as `python readport.py`,
      - the __name__ variable is set to '__main__'
    - otherwise, if the code is imported using a statement such as `import readport`
      - the __name__ variable is set to 'readport'


------------------------------------------
_119_packages

  The directory should have an __init__.py file, which may be empty. 
  Once youâ€™ve done this, you should be able to make nested import statements. 
  For example:
    import tutorial.readport 
    port = tutorial.readport.read_portfolio('portfolio.dat')
  shorter alternative
    from tutorial.readport import read_portfolio
    port = read_portfolio('portfolio.dat')
  
  Structuring a project:
  --
  tutorial-project/ 
    tutorial/
      __init__.py 
      readport.py 
      pcost.py 
      stack.py 
      ...
    tests/
      test_stack.py 
      test_pcost.py 
      ...
    examples/
      sample.py 
      ...
    doc/
      tutorial.txt
